## New in v1.1.1:
- Ability to override the announcement prefix spoken by Alexa.

## Overview

Alexa and other smart speakers (media_player) announce your doors/windows opening and closing. Comes in handy specially for garage doors or side/main exits for homes and shops where you need to stay informed of any changes. Trust me, it's a secured feeling to know the status of your garage, main/side exits.

Ever since we've set this up in our home, we don't think we can do without it now. Your home suddenly gets a voice, something like Jarvis ... Awesome!
